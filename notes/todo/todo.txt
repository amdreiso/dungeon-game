
LEVELS

when entering a new level the player will be granted a Trash weapon

levels will have rooms, such as gamble rooms(shops), and just rooms with enemies and all

when entering a level, the level progression will be completely random, having a number of said rooms before-hand like this:

gambleShops = 2; // 2 gamble shops in the level
normalRooms = 20; // 20 rooms with enemies
healthRooms = 5; // rooms with monument that heals the player

and the last room is going to have a boss

everytime you advance to a new room, the program will roll the dice to choose which room to put you in
